# Creating an automated RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service) instance and implementing a restore strategy using Terraform 

A high-level overview of the steps involved, along with some guidance on troubleshooting the issues you're facing. 
Please note that this overview assumes you have some familiarity with Terraform and AWS services.

1. Set up the necessary AWS and Terraform configurations:

- Ensure you have valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions.
- Install and configure Terraform on your local machine.
- Create a new Terraform project directory and initialize it.

2. Define your Terraform configuration files:

- Create a .tf file (e.g., main.tf) for your RDS instance configuration.
- Specify the required AWS provider and region.
- Define the RDS instance resource, specifying details such as engine, instance type, storage, etc.
- Define any necessary security groups, subnets, and parameter groups.

3. Configure automatic backups and enable the backup retention period:

- Specify the backup_retention_period for your RDS instance.
- Enable automated backups by setting backup_window and maintenance_window parameters.

4. Implement the restore strategy:

- Create a new .tf file for the restore configuration (e.g., restore.tf).
- Define a new RDS instance resource using the restored snapshot ID.
- Configure necessary settings like DB instance identifier, engine, instance type, security groups, etc.

5. Plan and apply your Terraform configuration:

- Run terraform init to initialize your Terraform project.
- Run terraform plan to verify the changes and ensure the configuration is correct.
- Run terraform apply to create the RDS instance and implement the restore strategy.

## Getting Started

To create the RDS instance and implement the restore strategy, follow these steps:

- Install Terraform on your local machine.
- Create a new directory for your Terraform project and place the main.tf and restore.tf files inside it.
- Initialize the project by running terraform init in the project directory.
- Review the Terraform plan by running terraform plan. It will show you the changes that Terraform will apply.
- Apply the changes by running terraform apply. Terraform will create the RDS instance and implement the restore strategy using the specified snapshot.
- Once the apply is complete, you should have your RDS instance created and the restore strategy implemented.
